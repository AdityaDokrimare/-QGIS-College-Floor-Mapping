# -QGIS-College-Floor-Mapping
This repository contains a floor-wise college ( Jhulelal Institute Of Technology , Maharashtra , Nagpur ) building map created using QGIS and integrated into Google Maps with .kml and .kmz formats. It enables accurate indoor navigation by mapping each class of the particular floor on the world map, improving campus accessibility and real-time navigation. This is one of the part of my project.
